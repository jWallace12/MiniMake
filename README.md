# MiniMake
A simple C implementation of the Base program "make"

This version of "make" supports using '#' as comments, recursively executes targets and dependencies, checks if files exist or if files have been updated since they were last executed, and parses out multi-line commands.

Main function: umake.c

Be sure to have a uMakefile in the local directory to run this program.
